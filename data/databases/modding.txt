hello modders!

here's how the player table in the database works:

the stat values in the profile_xml field denote the *distribution* of a player's skills, relative to each other.
the average of all profile stats should end up somewhere around 0.5.

the base_stat field denotes how good a player will be at his development peak (right now that's about age 27; future
versions will have various development curve options).

so if you want to make a player better or worse, change his base_stat value (or his age ;) ), NOT his profile_xml info.
profile_xml just describes what *type* of player we are talking about. for extra clarity on what it does: setting every
value in the profile_xml to 0.4 would result in a player with exactly the same ingame stats as setting every value to 0.6.

another thing; take into account that the format of the database and graphics may be subject to change for the full version.
so your mods may require adaptation when future version(s) are released. sorry about that!

have fun modding!
